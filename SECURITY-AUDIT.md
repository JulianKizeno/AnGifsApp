# Security review — 2026-11-14

This is a partial remediation, not a certification that the repository is free of vulnerabilities. Changes remain in a draft pull request pending review.

## .

npm findings before: {"info": 0, "low": 10, "moderate": 60, "high": 51, "critical": 8, "total": 129}. After remediation: {"info": 0, "low": 9, "moderate": 53, "high": 22, "critical": 0, "total": 84}.
Counts refer to dependency findings in this project, including development dependencies. Projects without a committed lockfile were first resolved to create an auditable baseline. Production builds were checked on Node.js 24 with CI=true, npm ci --ignore-scripts --legacy-peer-deps and NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider for legacy Webpack compatibility; these builds are not browser end-to-end tests.

Production build/test result: `{   "project": "AnGifsApp",   "manifest_sha256": "95337aa3d68c30cf8850240c179972f5cf421cbc4c39a9437a8666127b138e4c",   "lock_sha256": "4e32bc5c82ef4e1c7d3a1e8fa46e693de51ee3247bfbf99739bb76fb2cd848ae",   "install_exit": 0,   "build_exit": 0 }`.
